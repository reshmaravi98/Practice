Notes

Methods:
Common rules
1. Should be created outside the main method
2. Should be called inside the main method

void- doesnot return anything

any datatype (int, float, double, boolean, string)
     creation: add return statement at the end
     calling : should be called within sysout statement

Static method - fixed memory space

	syntax for creation: accessmodifier static  returntype name(){}
	syntax for calling:   classname.methodname();

	accessmodifier: public, private, protected
	returntype: void, int, float, double, boolean, char, string

Non static method - Does not contain fixed memory space, we have to create memory space

	syntax for creation: accessmodifier returntype name(){}
	syntax for calling:
                          classname objectname=new classname();
                          objectname.methodname();

common for both static and non-static method 

parameter:    variable passed to a function definition:   
syntax: 	  datatype variablename
argument:     value assigned to the parameter
